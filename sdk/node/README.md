Welcome to the **Node.js** implementation of the KuCoin Universal SDK. This SDK is built based on KuCoin API specifications to provide a comprehensive and optimized interface for interacting with the KuCoin platform.

For an overview of the project and SDKs in other languages, refer to the [Main README](https://github.com/kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk).

## üì¶ Installation

### Latest Version: `1.3.0`
Install the SDK using `npm`:

```bash
npm install kucoin-universal-sdk
```

## üìñ Getting Started

Here's a quick example to get you started with the SDK in **TypeScript**.

```ts
import {
    ClientOptionBuilder,
    DefaultClient,
    GlobalApiEndpoint,
    GlobalBrokerApiEndpoint,
    GlobalFuturesApiEndpoint,
    Spot,
    TransportOptionBuilder
} from 'kucoin-universal-sdk';

function example() {
    // Retrieve API secret information from environment variables
    const key = process.env.API_KEY || '';
    const secret = process.env.API_SECRET || '';
    const passphrase = process.env.API_PASSPHRASE || '';

    // Set specific options, others will fall back to default values
    const httpTransportOption = new TransportOptionBuilder()
        .setKeepAlive(true)
        .setMaxConnsPerHost(10)
        .setMaxIdleConns(10)
        .build();

    // Create a client using the specified options
    const clientOption = new ClientOptionBuilder()
        .setKey(key)
        .setSecret(secret)
        .setPassphrase(passphrase)
        .setSpotEndpoint(GlobalApiEndpoint)
        .setFuturesEndpoint(GlobalFuturesApiEndpoint)
        .setBrokerEndpoint(GlobalBrokerApiEndpoint)
        .setTransportOption(httpTransportOption)
        .build();

    const client = new DefaultClient(clientOption);

    // Get the Restful Service
    const kucoinRestService = client.restService();

    const spotMarketApi = kucoinRestService.getSpotService().getMarketApi();

    // Create request by interface
    let request = Spot.Market.GetPartOrderBookReq.create({
        'symbol': 'BTC-USDT',
        'size': '20',
    })

    // Or create request by builder
    request = Spot.Market.GetPartOrderBookReq.builder().setSize('20').setSymbol('BTC-USDT').build();

    // Query for part orderbook depth data. (aggregated by price)
    spotMarketApi.getPartOrderBook(request).then((result) => {
        console.log(`Time: ${result.time}, Seq: ${result.sequence}, Bids: ${result.bids}, Asks: ${result.asks}`);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error('fail to get part order book', err);
    })
}

## üìå Special Notes on APIs

This section provides specific considerations and recommendations for using the REST and WebSocket APIs.

### REST API Notes

#### Client Features
- **Advanced HTTP Handling**:
    - Supports retries, persistent connections, and connection pooling for efficient request handling.
- **Extensible Interceptors**:
    - Provides HTTP interceptors that users can extend to customize request and response processing.
- **Rich Response Details**:
    - Includes rate-limiting information and raw response data in API responses for better debugging and control.
- **Public API Access**:
    - For public endpoints, API keys are not required, simplifying integration for non-authenticated use cases.

---

### WebSocket API Notes

#### Client Features
- **Flexible Service Creation**:
    - Supports creating services for public/private channels in Spot, Futures, or Margin trading as needed.
    - Multiple services can be created independently.
- **Service Lifecycle**:
    - If a service is closed, create a new service instead of reusing it to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Connection-to-Channel Mapping**:
    - Each WebSocket connection corresponds to a specific channel type. For example:
        - Spot public/private and Futures public/private services require 4 active WebSocket connections.

#### Threading and Callbacks
- **Thread Model**:
    - WebSocket services follow a simple thread model, ensuring callbacks are handled on a single thread.
    - Although the above callback ensures single-threaded execution (guaranteed by Node.js's single-threaded model), the management of WebSocket connections, as well as message reception and transmission, is handled by a separate worker thread.
- **Subscription Management**:
    - A subscription is considered successful only after receiving an acknowledgment (ACK) from the server.
    - Each subscription has a unique ID, which can be used for unsubscribe.

#### Data and Message Handling
- **Framework-Managed Threads**:
    - Data messages are handled by a single framework-managed thread, ensuring orderly processing.
- **Buffer Management**:
    - When the message buffer is full, excess messages are dropped, and a notification event is sent.
- **Duplicate Subscriptions**:
    - Avoid overlapping subscription parameters. For example:
        - Subscribing to `["BTC-USDT", "ETH-USDT"]` and then to `["ETH-USDT", "DOGE-USDT"]` may result in undefined behavior.
        - Identical subscriptions will raise an error for duplicate subscriptions.

## üìë Parameter Descriptions

This section provides details about the configurable parameters for both HTTP and WebSocket client behavior.
